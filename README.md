# FedexSignupForm

// TO DO:
use angular material instead - done
use the validation of angular material - I've already done it before

1. make sure to take into account accessibility / semantic html
2. add tests
3. nice angular materail style
4. documentation in readme
5. add alert with a success - perhaps a homeo page to redirect to showing your information with a link back?

// consider turning sign up page into a separate module - overkill for now

imporvements:

1. make it mobile friendly
2. split each page intp a separate module - since there's only 1 page - this is an overkill
